export const MOCK_FAQS = [
    {
        question: "Does it sound like a robot?",
        answer: "No. We use ElevenLabs enterprise voice AI that's indistinguishable from human agents. We clone your voice or use professional agent voices. 94% of leads don't realize it's AI."
    },
    {
        question: "What if a lead asks something the AI can't answer?",
        answer: "The AI seamlessly transfers to your team via instant call forwarding. You get a text with full conversation context before picking up."
    },
    {
        question: "How long does implementation really take?",
        answer: "7 business days from signed agreement to fully operational. Day 1 is discovery, Days 2-5 we build your custom system, Days 6-7 we train your team and go live."
    },
    {
        question: "What CRMs can you integrate with?",
        answer: "We integrate with all major platforms: Zillow Premier Agent, Realtor.com, BoomTown, Follow Up Boss, Chime, KVCore, LionDesk, Wise Agent, Realty Juggler, and 40+ others via Zapier."
    },
    {
        question: "Can we customize what the AI says?",
        answer: "Absolutely. During discovery, we build custom scripts tailored to your market, price points, and selling style. You approve every word before we go live."
